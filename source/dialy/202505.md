## zsh escape quotes
```
If you're using zsh, you might also turn on the rcquotes option:

> Allow the character sequence '' to signify a single quote within singly quoted strings. Note this does not apply in quoted strings using the format $'...', where a backslashed single quote can be used.

Thus, instead of

alias striplines='print -lr awk '\'' /^$/ {print "\n"; } /./ {printf( " %s ",$0);}'\'
using rcquotes you could write

setopt rcquotes
alias striplines='print -lr awk '' /^$/ {print "\n"; } /./ {printf( " %s ",$0);}'''
or, by using $'...' you could write

alias striplines=$'print -lr awk \' /^$/ {print "\n"; } /./ {printf( " %s ",$0);}\''
```
